# CreditCard
Fraud Detection

This project aims to develop a machine learning model for detecting fraudulent credit card transactions. The model uses a dataset containing transaction details and employs techniques such as SMOTE to handle class imbalance.

Dataset
  Source: The dataset used is a publicly available credit card transaction dataset.
  https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kartik2112/fraud-detection

  Features:
      Time
      V1 to V28 (transaction features)
      Amount
      Class (0 for legitimate, 1 for fraudulent)

Size: Approximately 284,807 transactions.

Requirements
  Python: 3.8+
  Libraries:
    numpy
    pandas
    matplotlib
    seaborn
    scikit-learn
    imbalanced-learn

Installation
  To install the required libraries, run:

  bash
  pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn imbalanced-learn

Usage
  Clone the repository.

Update the file_path variable in the code to point to your dataset location.

Run the script to train and evaluate the model.

Model Details
  Model: Random Forest Classifier
  
  Balancing Technique: SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique)
  
  Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, AUC-ROC

Performance
The model's performance is evaluated based on its ability to detect fraudulent transactions accurately while minimizing false positives.

Future Enhancements
  Hyperparameter Tuning: Use GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV to optimize model parameters.
  Feature Engineering: Explore additional features such as transaction frequency or location-based features.
  Real-time Deployment: Integrate the model into a real-time transaction processing system.
